## 🧹 Data Preprocessing (Detailed)

Duplicate Removal – Identified and dropped duplicate property/project entries to ensure uniqueness.

Handling Missing Values –

Filled missing numerical values (e.g., Amenity_Score, Price_per_Sqft) using median imputation.

Replaced missing categorical fields (e.g., Configuration, Sales_Channel) with "Unknown".

Data Type Standardization – Converted:

Dates → datetime format for proper time-series analysis.

Prices → float in Crores (normalized).

Sqft values → integer.

Outlier Treatment – Detected extreme values in Price/Sqft, Traffic Time using IQR and capped them.

Feature Engineering – Created calculated fields:

Price_per_Sqft = Ticket_Price_Cr / Unit_Size_Sqft

Amenity Score Range = Categorized into Low / Medium / High

Booking Conversion Rate = Bookings ÷ Inquiries

Purchase_Quarter, Year, Quarter_Number derived from transaction date.

Normalization of Categorical Fields – Ensured uniform naming (e.g., “Ready to Move” vs “Ready-to-Move”).

Final Dataset – Cleaned dataset was stored back into staging tables before warehousing.
